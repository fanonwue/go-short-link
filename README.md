# go-short-link

A reimplementation using Golang of my existing link shortener, 
[easy-short-link](https://github.com/fanonwue/easy-short-link), which is based on Node.js. 
This Go-based version offers faster response times and way less memory consumption.
I also just wanted to try out Go, which I really like now. Kinda low-level, fast, but still with the comforts
that a garbage collector brings in.
