# go-short-link

A reimplementation using Golang of my existing link shortener, 
[easy-short-link](https://github.com/fanonwue/easy-short-link), which is based on Node.js. 
This Go-based version offers faster response times and way less memory consumption.
I also just wanted to try out Go, which I really like now. Kinda low-level, fast, but still with the comforts
that a garbage collector brings in.

## Setup

This server requires some special setup with Google Cloud stuff to be able to query Google Spreadsheets. As I
don't think anyone is using this software yet apart from myself, I honestly don't feel like writing setup docs
for this. This is a hobby project that I use for myself, but I don't mind helping people.

If you DO want to use this, open an issue please.
